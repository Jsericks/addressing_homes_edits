          <h3>Michael Olsen</h3>
          <p>Michael has been involved in the land development business for nearly 35 years. In 2004, Michael began working on a computer program that eventually became known as Aerial Imagery Mapping Technology (AIMTEC) whereby aerial imagery could be orthorectified into the State Plane Coordinate System and the aerial map could be drawn on using a Computer Aided Drafting system. Michael was awarded a US Patent on October 16, 2007, US Patent #7,283,909 B1. In 2007 and 2010 Michael traveled to Liberia to discuss the capabilities of AIMTEC as Liberia had just ended a 17 year Civil War where most of the maps and data within Liberia had been destroyed. In 2010 Michael began working on an addressing system for Liberia. Michael has since completed the addressing system to be known as Addressing Homes. Michael filed his International Patent in October of 2013 and formed the business entity Addressing Homes LLC. Michael is currently President of the AIMTEC Group and Chairman of Addressing Homes.</p>
